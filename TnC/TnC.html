          These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the access and use of
          services provided by Nexture Service (“Nexture”, “we”, “us”, or “our”)
          through our platform www.nextureservice.com (the “Website”) and via
          WhatsApp-based booking (collectively, the “Platform”). By booking or
          using any services provided by Nexture Service, you (“you” or
          “Customer”) agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
          Please read them carefully before proceeding.
        </p>

      <h2>1. Services Offered</h2>
      <div class="legal-card">
        <p>
          Nexture is a platform that enables customers to discover and book
          various home-based and personal care services such as cleaning,
          babysitting, elder care, beauty treatments, and more (“Nexture
          Services”). At present, all service bookings are accepted only through
          WhatsApp. These services are provided by trained and independent
          third-party service professionals (“Service Providers”) registered
          with us. Nexture does not directly offer or perform these services and
          shall not be liable for the quality, safety, or outcome of the
          services provided by the Service Providers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Booking and Cancellations</h2>
      <div class="legal-card">
        <p>
          All service bookings must be made via our official WhatsApp number.
          Customers are advised to provide accurate information including name,
          location, and service details to avoid delays or issues in service
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Services can be cancelled only if the cancellation request is made at
          least 6 hours prior to the scheduled booking time. Any cancellations
          beyond this timeframe may not be eligible for a refund or
          rescheduling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
      <div class="legal-card">
        <p>
          Full payment for the booked service is required in advance. This
          payment must be completed before the service provider arrives. In case
          the service requires any additional parts, consumables, or other
          components not included in the base service, these must be paid for
          separately and directly to the vendor at the time of service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment methods accepted include UPI, bank transfer, or other online
          methods as communicated by Nexture during booking.
